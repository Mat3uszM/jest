# babel-7
> This example shows how to setup jest with babel.

This is a barebones example that demonstrates jest and babel integration.

 **WARNING**
 
 If you are using jest version 23 with node version 10 and npm then this repository probably will not work for you. For more information please refer to this [jest issue](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/7395) on GitHub. This issue should be fixed in the next major release of jest (v24) when the dependency on babel 6 is dropped.
 
 You have two options solving this:
 1) Either switch to yarn; or
 2) Downgrade node to version 8. Consider using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) which simplifies managing multiple versions of node.
