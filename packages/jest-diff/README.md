# jest-diff

Display differences clearly so people can review changes confidently.

The default export serializes JavaScript **values** and compares them line-by-line.

Two named exports compare **strings** character-by-character:

- `diffStringsUnified` returns a string which includes comparison lines.
- `diffStringsRaw` returns an array of `Diff` objects.

## Installation

To add this package as a dependency of a project, run either of the following commands:

- `npm install jest-diff`
- `yarn add jest-diff`

## Usage of default export

Given values and optional options, `diffLinesUnified(a, b, options?)` does the following:

- **serialize** the values as strings using the `pretty-format` package
- **compare** the strings line-by-line using the `diff-sequences` package
- **format** the changed or common lines using the `chalk` package

To use this function, write either of the following:

- `const diffLinesUnified = require('jest-diff').default;` in CommonJS modules
- `import diffLinesUnified from 'jest-diff';` in ECMAScript modules

### Example of default export

```js
const a = ['delete', 'change from', 'common'];
const b = ['change to', 'insert', 'common'];

const difference = diffLinesUnified(a, b);
```

The returned **string** consists of:

- annotation lines: describe the two change indicators with labels, and a blank line
- comparison lines: similar to “unified” view on GitHub, but `Expected` lines are green, `Received` lines are red, and common lines are dim (by default, see Options)

```diff
- Expected
+ Received

  Array [
-   "delete",
-   "change from",
+   "change to",
+   "insert",
    "common",
  ]
```

### Edge cases of default export

Here are edge cases for the return value:

- `' Comparing two different types of values. …'` if the arguments have **different types** according to the `jest-get-type` package (instances of different classes have the same `'object'` type)
- `'Compared values have no visual difference.'` if the arguments have either **referential identity** according to `Object.is` method or **same serialization** according to the `pretty-format` package
- `null` if either argument is a so-called **asymmetric matcher** in Jasmine or Jest

## Usage of diffStringsUnified

Given strings and optional options, `diffStringsUnified(a, b, options?)` does the following:

- **compare** the strings character-by-character using the `diff-sequences` package
- **clean up** small (often coincidental) common substrings, also known as chaff
- **format** the changed or common lines using the `chalk` package

Although the function is mainly for **multiline** strings, it compares any strings.

Write either of the following:

- `const {diffStringsUnified} = require('jest-diff');` in CommonJS modules
- `import {diffStringsUnified} from 'jest-diff';` in ECMAScript modules

### Example of diffStringsUnified

```js
const a = 'change from\ncommon';
const b = 'change to\ncommon';

const difference = diffStringsUnified(a, b);
```

The returned **string** consists of:

- annotation lines: describe the two change indicators with labels, and a blank line
- comparison lines: similar to “unified” view on GitHub, and **changed substrings** have **inverse** foreground and background colors (which the following example does not show)

```diff
- Expected
+ Received

- change from
+ change to
  common
```

### Edge cases of diffStringsUnified

Here are edge cases for the return value:

- both `a` and `b` are empty strings: no comparison lines
- only `a` is empty string: all comparison lines have `bColor` and `bIndicator` (see Options)
- only `b` is empty string: all comparison lines have `aColor` and `aIndicator` (see Options)
- `a` and `b` are equal non-empty strings: all comparison lines have `commonColor` and `commonIndicator` (see Options)

### Performance of diffStringsUnified

To get the benefit of **changed substrings** within the comparison lines, a character-by-character comparison has a higher computational cost (in time and space) than a line-by-line comparison.

If the input strings can have **arbitrary length**, we recommend that the calling code set a limit, beyond which it calls the default export instead. For example, Jest falls back to line-by-line comparison if either string has length greater than 20K characters.

## Usage of diffStringsRaw

Given strings and boolean, `diffStringsRaw(a, b, cleanup)` does the following:

- **compare** the strings character-by-character using the `diff-sequences` package
- optionally **clean up** small (often coincidental) common substrings, also known as chaff

Write one of the following:

- `const {diffStringsRaw} = require('jest-diff');` in CommonJS modules
- `import {diffStringsRaw} from 'jest-diff';` in ECMAScript modules

Because `diffStringsRaw` returns the difference as **data** instead of a string, you can format it as your application requires (for example, enclosed in HTML markup for browser instead of escape sequences for console).

The returned **array** describes substrings as instances of the `Diff` class, which calling code can access like array tuples:

The value at index `0` is one of the following:

| value | named export  | description           |
| ----: | :------------ | :-------------------- |
|   `0` | `DIFF_EQUAL`  | in `a` and in `b`     |
|  `-1` | `DIFF_DELETE` | in `a` but not in `b` |
|   `1` | `DIFF_INSERT` | in `b` but not in `a` |

The value at index `1` is a substring of `a` or `b` or both.

### Example of diffStringsRaw with cleanup

```js
const diffs = diffStringsRaw('change from', 'change to', true);

/*
diffs[0][0] === 0 // DIFF_EQUAL
diffs[0][1] === 'change '

diffs[1][0] === -1 // DIFF_DELETE
diffs[1][1] === 'from'

diffs[2][0] === 1 // DIFF_INSERT
diffs[2][1] === 'to'
*/
```

### Example of diffStringsRaw without cleanup

```js
const diffs = diffStringsRaw('change from', 'change to', false);

/*
diffs[0][0] === 0 // DIFF_EQUAL
diffs[0][1] === 'change '

diffs[1][0] === -1 // DIFF_DELETE
diffs[1][1] === 'fr'

diffs[2][0] === 1 // DIFF_INSERT
diffs[2][1] === 't'

// Here is a small coincidental common substring:
diffs[3][0] === 0 // DIFF_EQUAL
diffs[3][1] === 'o'

diffs[4][0] === -1 // DIFF_DELETE
diffs[4][1] === 'm'
*/
```

### Advanced import for diffStringsRaw

Here are all the named imports for the `diffStringsRaw` function:

- `const {DIFF_DELETE, DIFF_EQUAL, DIFF_INSERT, Diff, diffStringsRaw} = require('jest-diff');` in CommonJS modules
- `import {DIFF_DELETE, DIFF_EQUAL, DIFF_INSERT, Diff, diffStringsRaw} from 'jest-diff';` in ECMAScript modules

To write a **formatting** function, you might need the named constants (and `Diff` in TypeScript annotations).

If you write an application-specific **cleanup** algorithm, then you might need to call the `Diff` constructor:

```js
const diffCommon = new Diff(DIFF_EQUAL, 'change ');
const diffDelete = new Diff(DIFF_DELETE, 'from');
const diffInsert = new Diff(DIFF_INSERT, 'to');
```

## Options

The default options are for the report when an assertion fails from the `expect` package used by Jest.

For other applications, you can provide an options object as a third argument:

- `diffLinesUnified(a, b, options)`
- `diffStringsUnified(a, b, options)`

### Properties of options object

| name                  | default         |
| :-------------------- | :-------------- |
| `aAnnotation`         | `'Expected'`    |
| `aColor`              | `chalk.green`   |
| `aIndicator`          | `'-'`           |
| `bAnnotation`         | `'Received'`    |
| `bColor`              | `chalk.red`     |
| `bIndicator`          | `'+'`           |
| `changeColor`         | `chalk.inverse` |
| `commonColor`         | `chalk.dim`     |
| `commonIndicator`     | `' '`           |
| `contextLines`        | `5`             |
| `expand`              | `true`          |
| `includeChangeCounts` | `false`         |
| `omitAnnotationLines` | `false`         |
| `patchColor`          | `chalk.yellow`  |

### Example of options for labels

If the application is code modification, you might replace the labels:

```js
const options = {
  aAnnotation: 'Original',
  bAnnotation: 'Modified',
};
```

The `jest-diff` package does not assume that the 2 labels have equal length.

### Example of options for colors of changed lines

For consistency with most diff tools, you might exchange the colors:

```js
import chalk from 'chalk';

const options = {
  aColor: chalk.red,
  bColor: chalk.green,
};
```

### Example of option for color of changed substrings

Although the default inverse of foreground and background colors is hard to beat for changed substrings **within lines**, especially because it highlights spaces, if you want bold font weight on yellow background:

```js
const options = {
  changeColor: chalk.bold.bgAnsi256(226), // #ffff00
};
```

### Example of options for no colors

The value of a color option is a function, which given a string, returns a string.

To store the difference in a file without escape codes for colors, provide an identity function:

```js
const identity = string => string;

const options = {
  aColor: identity,
  bColor: identity,
  changeColor: identity,
  commonColor: identity,
  patchColor: identity,
};
```

### Example of options for indicators

For consistency with the `diff` command, you might replace the indicators:

```js
const options = {
  aIndicator: '<',
  bIndicator: '>',
};
```

The `jest-diff` package assumes (but does not enforce) that the 3 indicators have equal length.

### Example of options to limit common lines

By default, the output includes all common lines.

To emphasize the changes, you might limit the number of common “context” lines:

```js
const options = {
  contextLines: 1,
  expand: false,
};
```

A patch mark like `@@ -12,7 +12,9 @@` accounts for omitted common lines.

### Example of option for color of patch marks

If you want patch marks to have the same dim color as common lines:

```js
const options = {
  expand: false,
  patchColor: chalk.dim,
};
```

### Example of option to include change counts

To display the number of changed lines at the right of annotation lines:

```js
const a = ['change from', 'common'];
const b = ['change to', 'insert', 'common'];
const options = {
  includeChangeCounts: true,
};

const difference = diffLinesUnified(a, b, options);
```

```diff
- Expected  1 -
+ Received  2 +

  Array [
-   "change from",
+   "change to",
+   "insert",
    "common",
  ]
```

### Example of option to omit annotation lines

To display only the comparison lines:

```js
const a = 'change from\ncommon';
const b = 'change to\ncommon';
const options = {
  omitAnnotationLines: true,
};

const difference = diffStringsUnified(a, b, options);
```

```diff
- change from
+ change to
  common
```
