This should be an introduction to mocking. Not as in-depth as [Mock Functions](/jest/docs/mock-functions.html), just one specific use of mocking that would be useful in a simple test case.

We actually have such an example in the current [Async Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-async.html#content), where `request` is mocked. Can we use a similar example here - mocking a network request - to introduce the concept of mocking?

At the end of this doc, we can link to [Mock Functions](/jest/docs/mock-functions.html) for a full reference.

It should also introduce the next section, async testing, with some comment related to why async testing may be needed in a project.

Note that Eric is currently reworking the Async Tutorial in [#2376](https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/2376).
