Install Jest using `npm`:

```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Let's get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a `sum.js` file:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
module.exports = sum;
```

Then, create a file named `sum.test.js`. This will contain our actual test:

```javascript
const sum = require('./sum');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Finally, run `npm test`. Jest will print this message:

```
PASS  ./sum.test.js
âœ“ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)
```

You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest!

This test used `expect` and `toBe` to test that two values were exactly identical. To learn about the other things that Jest can test, see [Using Matchers](/jest/docs/using-matchers.html).
