# Jest website

The Jest website is based on [Docusaurus 2](http://v2.docusaurus.io/).

## Run the dev server

You will need Node >=10.

The first time, get all the dependencies loaded via

```bash
yarn
```

in the root directory.

Fetch `backers.json` file by running

```bash
node fetchSupporters.js
```

Then, run the server via

```bash
yarn start
```

Note, you can also use `yarn workspace jest-website start` from the root of the Jest monorepo.

## Publish the website

TODO will be completed later, once we know how we'll deploy the new website
